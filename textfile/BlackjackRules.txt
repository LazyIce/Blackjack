    In Blackjack, or 21, the player must decide what to bet before the hand. Click the chips to add them to your bet. Click the chip again to remove it back to your pile of money. Once you click "deal" your bet is set, and two cards are dealt to the player face up and two cards are dealt to the dealer, one face up and one face down. You must then decide if you will "hit" (take another card from the deck), "stand" (keep the hand you are dealt), or "double" (you double your bet and are given only one more card). If the dealer has an Ace showing, you can click the "Insurance" button (this means you will place a bet worth half your hand bet, which will be paid out if the dealer has Blackjack but will be taken if the dealer does not).

    Once the Blackjack hand is played out, three outcomes can occur. First you can win (as previously described), secondly you can lose (bust hand or have less than dealer hand), or you can push (have same hand - number count or Blackjack - as dealer). If you win, you get your bet money back PLUS that same amount from the dealer, YAY! If you win with Blackjack, you get your original bet back PLUS you win 1.5 times your bet from the dealer, WOOHOO! If you lose, the dealer takes your bet money. If you push, you keep your bet money but do not win anything additional.
